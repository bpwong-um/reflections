When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a local repository fosters collaboration and working on files from different access points.

================

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Control.  The version on the local branch may have changes that do not appear on the remote repository and these could get overwritten
if pull was done automatically.
